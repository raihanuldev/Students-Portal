# Student-Portal - Bangladesh Sweden Polytechnic Institute

## Project Overview

The **Student-Portal** is a web application developed for the students of Bangladesh Sweden Polytechnic Institute. This platform aims to streamline various student-related activities by providing a centralized system for information management and communication.

The project primarily focuses on utilizing **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)** for efficient state management and data fetching. The frontend is built with **React** and **TypeScript** for type safety, while **Ant Design (antd)** is used for the UI components. The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, with **MongoDB** as the database solution. Authentication is handled through a custom authentication system to keep the process simple and tailored to the project's needs.

## Key Features
